      <h3>How to use the file</h3>
      <p>
        The survey table contains at least 6 columns, which are MD, Inclination, Azimuth, TVD, North, East so that the functions can operate correctly.<br>
        The table's final row must be left empty, serving as a marker for the functions that the array of chosen data has finished. <br>
        All the cells outside the data range is free to use. <br>
        The unit is determined by the input unit. <br>
        I.E if the input of MD is in meter, the output will be in meter and vice versa. <br>
